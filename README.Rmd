# "InvestigatoR" that's what she said!

The **goal of InvestigatoR** is to provide a comprehensive toolkit for quantitative finance professionals and researchers to conduct advanced backtesting and portfolio analysis using machine learning models. 

It offers:

- a streamlined *workflow* for loading data
- specifying *features*
- configuring *machine learning models*
- and analyzing the *performance of predictions and portfolio strategies*. 

This facilitates the evaluation of investment strategies, helping users to optimize returns and manage risks more effectively in their financial models.

More in detail, the package allows the user to create:

- `returnPrediction`: An S3 object that contains the results of the backtesting strategy for predicting stock returns. One can subsequently try different prediction algorithms and all save them in the same object. The object then contains, (i) information on the algorithm and parameters used, (ii) the predictions, (iii) the real returns as well as (iv) the respective errors. Using `summary()` on this object will produce common error statistics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, ...).
- `backtesting_returns()`: This function is one of the major workhorses of the package. It predicts a label (mostly the returns, but can also be other labels, such as the volatility) for a set of given assets and dates based on available features. The function allows for different machine learning algorithms, some are pre-implemented, such as linear regression, gradient boosting, and random forests, others can easily be added (see `vignette("custom_predictions")`). It contains a large variety of configuration options, such as rolling or expanding windows, window sizes, step sizes, and offsets. The function adds predictions and all necessary information to the `returnPrediction` S3 object. Currently implemented prediction functions:

    - `ols_pred`: predicts returns using simple linear regression
    - `xgb_pred`: predicts returns using gradient boosted trees
    - `rf_pred`: predicts returns using random forests

In the future we plan a major upgrade to the function to be able to handle caret models as well as other machine learning models.
- `portfolioReturns`: Another S3 object that contains the results of the backtesting strategy for a portfolio. The object contains (i) information on the weight creation strategy and function used, including possible constraints and parameters, (ii) the weights created per asset and date, (iii) the actual asset returns and (iv) the (automatically calculated) portfolio returns. Using `summary()` on this object will produce common performance statistics (mean, standard deviation, Share Ratio, VaR, turnover), but can also handle almost all `PerformanceAnalytics` functions and tables. An additional `plot` routine will produce a cumulative return plot of the portfolio, but can also handle various predefined plots from the `PerformanceAnalytics` package.
- `backtesting_portfolio()`: This function is the second major work horse of the package. It uses the predictions contained in a `returnPrediction` object to create portfolio weights implementing various constraints and strategies. It also allows for different holding periods, such as daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly. The function adds the portfolio weights and all necessary information to the `portfolioReturns` S3 object. Currently implemented portfolio functions:

    - `quantile_weights`: creates quantile portfolio weights based on the predictions
    - `ensemble_weights`: creates ensemble portfolio weights based on several predictions using a 
        -  simple average, a 
        -  weighted average based on the inverse MSE, or a 
        -  Minimum Variance approach using the covariance matrix of errors.
The function returns a `portfolioReturns` object that can be used for further analysis.

# Installation

You can install the development version of InvestigatoR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install_package, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sstoeckl/InvestigatoR")
```

# Package History

-  0.2.0: Major update of all functions, complete rewriting of package structure.

# Package Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem. First, we load the `InvestigatoR`-package and the `tidyverse`-package:

```{r load_package, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(InvestigatoR)
library(tidyverse)
## basic example code
```

Next, we load the complimentary dataset that comes with the package:

```{r load_data}
data("data_ml")
data_ml |> distinct(date) |> pull(date) |> min()
data_ml |> distinct(date) |> pull(date) |> max()
```

For a description, see.... The original datset was provided by Guillaume Coqueret and Tony Guida with their book [Machine Learning for Factor Investing](https://mlfactor.com).

Next we specify the set of features that should be used for return prediction, specify some options for backtesting, such as whether the return prediction should be done with a rolling window (TRUE), the window size ("5 years"), the step size("3 months", this means, how often do we re-estimate the ML model), the offset ("1 year" to avoid any form of data spillage).

```{r specify_features}
return_label <- "R1M_Usd"
features <- c("Div_Yld", "Eps", "Mkt_Cap_12M_Usd", "Mom_11M_Usd", "Ocf", "Pb", "Vol1Y_Usd")
rolling <- FALSE; window_size= "5 years"; step_size = "1 months"; offset = "1 month"; in_sample = TRUE
```

Next we specify the machine learning configuration. We can specify multiple configurations, for example, one for a linear regression model and one for a gradient boosting model. The configuration for the linear regression model is empty, as we use the default configuration. The configuration for the gradient boosting model specifies the number of rounds, the maximum depth of the trees, the learning rate, and the objective function. Other functions still need to be implemented.

```{r specify_ml_config}
 ml_config <- list(ols_pred = list(pred_func="ols_pred", config=list()),
                   xgb_pred = list(pred_func="xgb_pred", 
                                   config1=list(nrounds=10, max_depth=3, eta=0.3, objective="reg:squarederror"),
                                   config2=list(nrounds=10, max_depth=3, eta=0.1, objective="reg:squarederror")))
```

Finally, we call the backtesting function. 

```{r backtesting_returns}
 rp <- backtesting_returns(data=data_ml, return_prediction_object=NULL,
   return_label, features, rolling=FALSE, window_size, step_size, offset, in_sample, ml_config, append=FALSE, num_cores=NULL)
```

The function returns an S3 object of class `returnPrediction` that contains all the information associated with the backtesting results. It contains information on the used models (`rp$models`), the predictions (`rp$predictions`), as well as the actual returns (`rp$actual_returns`) and the errors (`rp$errors`). We provide a summary routine via `summary()` that calculates the Mean-Squared-Error (MSE), the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE), the Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE), and the Hit-Ratio (the percentage of correct predictions).

```{r analyse_predictions}
rp$predictions |> head()
rp_stats <- summary(rp)
print(rp_stats)
```

Next, we map those predictions into various portfolios (quantiles) and analyse their performance. Therefore, we specify a mapping_function (can be individually provided), and a portfolio configuration. The mapping function is a function that maps the predictions into portfolio weights. We provide two functions, `quantile_weights` and `ensemble_weights`. The portfolio configuration specifies the quantiles that should be used for the portfolio formation, as well as various constraints and parameters. Additionally we can specify various portfolio restrictions, such as the minimum and maximum weight, the minimum and maximum cutoff quantile, and the b parameter that adjusts the amount of investment per leg (b=1 means, we go 100% long and short). We also specify the predictions that should be used for the portfolio formation (e.g., 'ols_1', 'xgb_1', 'xgb_2').


```{r specify_pf_config}
pf_config <- list(predictions = c("ols_1","xgb_1","xgb_2"),
                  quantile_weight = list(pred_func="quantile_weights",
                    config1=list(quantiles = list(long = 0.20, short = 0.20),allow_short_sale = FALSE,
                      min_weight = 0,  max_weight = 1, b = 1),
                    config2=list(quantiles = list(long = 0.10, short = 0.10),allow_short_sale = FALSE,
                      min_weight = 0,  max_weight = 1, b = 1)))
```

Finally we run the portfolio formation process.

```{r backtesting_portfolios}
pf <- backtesting_portfolios(return_prediction_object = rp, pf_config = pf_config)
```
This creates another S3 object of class `portfolio` that contains all the information associated with the portfolio formation. It contains information on the portfolio models used (`pf$weight_models`), the actual returns of the assets (`pf$actual_returns`), the portfolio returns (`pf$portfolio_returns`). We provide a summary routine via `summary()` that calculates the Mean, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, and the Calmar Ratio.


), the portfolio weights (`pf$weights`), the actual returns of the assets (`pf$actual_returns`), the portfolio returns (`pf$portfolio_returns`). We provide a summary routine via `summary()` that calculates the Mean, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio, Value at Risk, as well as the turnover.

```{r check_pf}
pf$weights |> head()
pf$portfolio_returns |> head()
pf_stats <- summary(pf)
print(pf_stats)
```

Alternatively, we can also calculate statistics from the `PerformanceAnalytics` package.

```{r check_pf_perf}
library(tidyquant)
# tidyquant::tq_performance_fun_options()
summary(pf)
summary(pf, type = "table.AnnualizedReturns")
summary(pf, type = "table.Distributions")
summary(pf, type = "table.DownsideRisk")
summary(pf, type = "table.DrawdownsRatio")
summary(pf, type = "cov")
```


Additionally, we provide a standard plotting routine for the portfolio object via `plot`.

```{r plot_pf}
plot(pf)
```

Alternatively, the plotting function is designed in  a way, that it takes plotting function from the `tidyquant` package as inputs. 

```{r plot_pf_tq, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyquant)
ls("package:PerformanceAnalytics")[grepl("chart",ls("package:PerformanceAnalytics"))]
plot(pf, type = "chart.CumReturns")
plot(pf, type = "charts.PerformanceSummary")
plot(pf, type = "chart.Boxplot")
```

# Implement own Functions

Lets start with a simple random forest implementation. We need to specify the function that should be used for the prediction, the configuration of the function, and the name of the function. The logic is easy: create a function `rf_pred` having arguments: 'train_data', 'test_data', as well as a 'config' that is taken by the prediction function.

```{r specify_rf_config}
rf_config <- list(rf_pred = list(pred_func="rf_pred", 
                                 config1=list(num.trees=100, max.depth=3, mtry=3)))
```

Next we implement this prediction function. The function takes the training data, the test data, and the configuration as arguments and returns the predicted returns. It uses the `ranger` package to fit a random forest model to the training data and to predict the returns for the test data.

```{r implement_rf}
rf_pred <- function(train_data, test_data, config) {
  train_features <- (train_data[,4:ncol(train_data)])
  train_label <- as.matrix(train_data[,3])
  # add data
  config$x <- train_features
  config$y <- train_label
  # do the training
  fit <- do.call(ranger::ranger, config)
  # do the predictions
  predictions <- as.vector(predict(fit, test_data)$predictions)
  # match preds back to stock_id and date
  predictions <- tibble::tibble(stock_id=test_data$stock_id, date=test_data$date, pred_return=predictions)
  return(predictions)
}
```

Finally, we call the `backtesting_returns` function with the new configuration. The function returns a data frame with the backtesting results and appends them to the existing return prediction object 'rf'.

```{r backtesting_returns_rf}
rp_rf <- backtesting_returns(data=data_ml, return_prediction_object=rp,
   return_label, features, rolling=FALSE, window_size, step_size, offset, in_sample, rf_config, append=FALSE, num_cores=NULL)
```
We can check, whether the random forest produces better predictions than the other models:

```{r analyse_predictions_rf}
rp_rf$predictions |> head()
rp_rf_stats <- summary(rp_rf)
print(rp_rf_stats)
```

Let us recreate the portfolio formation process with the new prediction object.

```{r backtesting_portfolios_rf}
pf_config <- list(predictions = c("xgb_2","rf_1"),
                  quantile_weight = list(pred_func="quantile_weights",
                    config1=list(quantiles = list(long = 0.20, short = 0.20),allow_short_sale = FALSE,
                      min_weight = -1,  max_weight = 1, b = 1),
                    config2=list(quantiles = list(long = 0.10, short = 0.10),allow_short_sale = FALSE,
                      min_weight = -1,  max_weight = 1, b = 1)))
pf_rf <- backtesting_portfolios(return_prediction_object = rp_rf, pf_config = pf_config)
```

And finally summarise the portfolio statistics.

```{r check_pf_rf}
plot(pf_rf)
pf_rf_stats <- summary(pf_rf)
print(pf_rf_stats)
```
